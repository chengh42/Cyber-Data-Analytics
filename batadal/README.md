# Anomaly detection with BATADAL dataset

The BATtle of the Attack Detection ALgorithms (BATADAL) data is the hourly historical supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) operations of the C-Town water distribution system ([R. Taormina et al, 2018](http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/%28ASCE%29WR.1943-5452.0000969)).
The coursework aims at learning a sequential model for anomaly detection.
