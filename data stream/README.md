# Data streaming

Author: H. Cheng & P. de Biase

This assignment provides a brief look into data stream mining for anomaly detections. 
Profiling and fingerprinting are two key techniques in this domain. 
Here we apply these techniques using the CTU-13 dataset for this assignment.

The scripts for this assignment include:

- Task 1. Sampling
- Task 2. Sketching
- Task 3. Discretisation
- Task 4. Profiling
- Task 5. Classification
