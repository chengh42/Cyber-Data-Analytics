# Credit card fraud detection

The coursework aims at incorporating data pre-/post-processing for imbalanced data to improve the performance of predictive models for credict card fraud detection. This study evaluates a few machine learning algorithms and compare the results among SMOTE'd and un-SMOTE'd data.
